    <p>
        Hi! I'm Oliver. I'm 20 years old, a recent university dropout, currently college student. I really struggled in the university environment, since in all honesty I was just there because my parents asked me to, and neither them or me even considered college as an option (i was surrounded by STEM freaks that would constantly yell in my and everyone else's ear "you're getting a USELESS degree, if you don't go into ENGINEERING or CS you're gonna be POOR and NEVER find a job" and i let that get to my head). I've always been great at digital design stuff (like anything involving computers BESIDES coding/programming). I used to do this stuff as a hobby when I was younger, I'd use photoshop to make funny inside-joke related images, use Vegas Pro to edit video game montages for my friends, and a tiny bit of digital music stuff in FL Studio (i've been recently thinking about getting back into that too as a little hobby, along with some vocaloid software). The few classes where I got to make use of those skills were the only places I found real success in school, and I really regret not pursuing it earlier. But after 2.5 years of a passionless slog of a university experience, I'm here now and very excited for the rest of my time here!

        <h3>Balatro</h3>
        Let me tell you about a little game called Balatro. Balatro is a simple playing card based computer game made by ONE hobbiest game-dev in his free time, where you create poker hands to score BIG points. For example, when you start a new run, the first blind requires you to get 300 points. 8 cards are then drawn from the <abbr title="a standard 52-card playing card deck, four cards of each rank for each of the four suits">deck</abbr>, and in four playable hands, as well as the option to discard and re-draw up to five of your cards, you try to make the best poker hands possible to meet that score (for example, if you play a <abbr title="[e.g. 6,7,8,9,10] of any suits">Straight</abbr>, you'll score around 280 points, then you could finish it off with a simple <abbr title="two of the same rank (e.g. 6, 6)">pair</abbr> or <abbr title="three cards of the same rank (e.g. 10, 10, 10)">three of a kind</abbr>, which would give you like 40-100 points). The fun part comes in where you then earn MONEY from beating that first requirement, which you can then use to buy JOKERS (you can have up to 5 by default) which have unique abilities that let you either increase your score, earn you extra money, make difficult-to-get hands easier to draw, and a LOT more. As a little nod to how unique some of these joker abilities, and the synergies between them get, there's this joker called Baron, which MULTIPLIES the score of your played hand by 1.5 for every King <em>held in your hand</em> while the hand is played. That, combined with the Mime joker, which retriggers every <em>"held in hand"</em> ability, will let you get CRAZY high scores. So if you played a <abbr title="three cards of the same rank (e.g. 10, 10, 10)">Three of a Kind</abbr>, and it were to score let's say 150 points, and you have five kings left in your hand with those two jokers equipped, each one of those kings would multiply your score by 1.5 TWICE, which would total up to a monumental <strong><em>8,650</em></strong> points. That's a little simplified explanation, but that's just a little glimpse into how well-thought-out every element of the game was implemented. Over the past two years of playing, I've accumulated over 600 hours in the game (my 3<sup>rd</sup> most played game ever), and have beaten the highest difficulty with all 150 jokers. I love this game very much, and I'd reccomend it to just about anyone.
